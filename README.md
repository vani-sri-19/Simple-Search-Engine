# Simple-Search-Engine
A lightweight Information Retrieval System built on Cranfield data, implementing three retrieval models:
-> Best Match (BM25) Model
-> Vector Space Model
-> Language Model (Jelinek-Mercer Smoothing)

# Features
1) Text Preprocessing:
   1.1) Lowercasing
   1.2) Stop word removal
   1.3) Stemming
   1.4) Lemmatization
   1.5) Tokenization
   1.6) Special character & number removal
   1.7) HTML tags removal
3) Inverted Index Construction: Efficient indexing of corpus documents.
4) Query Processing: Preprocessing applied to query terms for consistency.
5) Information Retrieval: Information Retrieval using all the 3 models respectively.
6) Model Evaluation: Performance assessed using Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) standards.




Information Retrieval System on Cranfield data using Best Match (BM25) Model, Vector Space Model and a Language Model (Jelinek Mercer Smoothing).
Pre-processing steps like stop words removal, stemming, special character removal, number removal, HTML tags removal, tokenization and lemmetization for both corpus text and query terms
Built inverted index for the corpus text/ documents
Evaluation of each model using Text REtrieval Conference(TREC).
